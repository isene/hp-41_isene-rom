## The most useful of my FOCAL programs

The most useful of my FOCAL programs below is now contained in one 4K ROM
image – the ISENE.ROM. Here you will find the Ultimate Alarm Clock, the
PDA programs NOTES and REM as well as CRYPT to encrypt and decrypt ascii
files and other neat stuff for your HP-41. A must for handling HEPAX files
and XM files.

Read the pdf manual for a full overview.

This updated version was easily created with Håkan Thörngren's NutStudio.
